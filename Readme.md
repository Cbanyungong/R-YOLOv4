# R-YOLOv4

This is a PyTorch-based R-YOLOv4 implementation which combines YOLOv4 model and loss function from R3Det for arbitrary oriented object detection.

### Dataset

**UCAS-High Resolution Aerial Object Detection Dataset (UCAS-AOD)**

Label: x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4, theta, x, y, width, height </br>
(x1, y1) is the coordinate located on the upper left of the bounding box, and then (x2, y2), (x3, y3) and (x4, y4) following the clockwise order respectively.

Though it provides theta for each bounding box, it is not within the angle range that I want. You can check out how I calculated the angle that I need in tools/load.py.

### Loss Function

<img src="./images/angle.png" alt="angle" height="70"/>

I implemented the loss function proposed by [R3Det: Refined Single-Stage Detector with Feature Refinement for Rotating Object](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05612) and made some adjustments for myself.

### Recall

As the paper suggested, I get a better results from **f(ariou) = exp(1-ariou)-1**. Therefore I used it for my loss function.


### Usage

1. Clone and install requirements
```
$ git clone https://github.com/kkkunnnnethan/R-YOLOv4.git
$ cd R-YOLOv4/
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Download dataset and weights

* Dataset </br>
I have  provided some datasets example on my github. Still, you have to download the others by yourself and arrange it in the correct directories like I do.
* Weights </br>
[yolov4 pretrained weights](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1UDp_DB2gbPSzBIpgAJuLIFqu8hgl57Ip) </br>
[UCAS-AOD weights](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1sVD2d_y9VDirA-XOdcVDKCDrQw3e7ZJY) (weights that I have already trained for this dataset)

*Alexey Bochkovskiy, Chien-Yao Wang, Hong-Yuan Mark Liao*

**Abstract**
There are a huge number of features which are said to improve Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) accuracy. Practical testing of combinations of such features on large datasets, and theoretical justification of the result, is required. Some features operate on certain models exclusively and for certain problems exclusively, or only for small-scale datasets; while some features, such as batch-normalization and residual-connections, are applicable to the majority of models, tasks, and datasets...

**R3Det: Refined Single-Stage Detector with Feature Refinement for Rotating Object**

*Xue Yang, Junchi Yan, Ziming Feng, Tao He*

**Abstract**
Rotation detection is a challenging task due to the difficulties of locating the multi-angle objects and separating them effectively from the background. Though considerable progress has been made, for practical settings, there still exist challenges for rotating objects with large aspect ratio, dense distribution and category extremely imbalance. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end refined single-stage rotation detector for fast and accurate object detection by using a progressive regression approach from coarse to fine granularity...
